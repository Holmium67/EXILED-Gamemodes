Survival
======
## Description
A configurable number of Peanuts (default 3) will be spawned and locked in their room for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, everyone else is spawned as a Class-D in HCZ (SCP-096's spawn) and have to find hiding places in HCZ.

After the 2 minutes has passed, the lights will turn off and the peanuts will be set free in SCP-939's room.

The players basically play hide and seek in the dark, with peanuts.
The last Class-D alive wins.

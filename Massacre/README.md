Massacre
======
## Description
The entirety of this event will occur inside the Surface-zone jail room. A configurable number of peanuts (3 by default) will be spawned, and everyone else will spawn as Class-D. All Class-D are immediately teleported to the Surface-room Jail tower, and 3 seconds later the peanuts will join them.

The last Class-D alive is the winner.

Outbreak
======
## Description
All SCPs will be turned into "Alpha" zombies. These zombies are given a lot more health than normal ones, and will (if configured) break locked doors when they try to open them (or in the case of unbreakable doors, open them). When any human dies to any cause, they will be turned into a zombie.

The round ends when all zombies or all humans are dead.
